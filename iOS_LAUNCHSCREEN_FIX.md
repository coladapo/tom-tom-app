# iOS Build Fix - LaunchScreen.storyboard

## âœ… Issue Fixed

The missing `LaunchScreen.storyboard` file has been added to the repository.

## ðŸ”„ Steps to Apply the Fix

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
```bash
cd tom-tom-app
git pull origin main
```

2. **Clean and rebuild in Xcode:**
- In Xcode: `Product` â†’ `Clean Build Folder` (Cmd+Shift+K)
- Then build again: `Product` â†’ `Build` (Cmd+B)

3. **Run the app:**
- Click the Run button or press Cmd+R

## ðŸ“‹ About the Warnings

The two script phase warnings are **normal for React Native development**:

### 1. "Bundle React Native code and images"
- This bundles your JavaScript code
- It needs to run every build during development
- This is expected behavior

### 2. "Start Packager" 
- This starts the Metro bundler
- Also needs to run during development
- This is expected behavior

### Optional: Silence the Warnings

If you want to remove these warnings (not required):

1. In Xcode, select your project â†’ TomTom target
2. Go to Build Phases tab
3. For each script phase:
   - Click the arrow to expand it
   - Uncheck "Based on dependency analysis"
   - OR add output files like `${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/bundle.js`

**Note:** These warnings don't affect the build and are safe to ignore.

## ðŸŽ¨ Launch Screen Details

The new launch screen features:
- Warm off-white background (#F9F7F6) matching the app's design
- "Tom Tom" text centered on screen
- Clean, minimal design consistent with the app's aesthetic

Your app should now build successfully! ðŸš€
